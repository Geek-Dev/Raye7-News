# Raye7-News
Raye7 News App Keep updated with the latest news

# Project Overview
It uses newsapi.org API to get news and get JSON data back. Then it is parsed using gson library and the requests are sent by Retrofit2.<br/>

Note: To run the app you have to add NewsAPI.org key. I have taken this step to due to limited access to daily request for News. Getting a key would take just few seconds :)<br/>
