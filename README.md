# Raye7-News
Raye7 News App Keep updated with the latest news

# Project Overview
It uses newsapi.org API to get news and get JSON data back. Then it is parsed using gson library and the requests are sent by Retrofit2.<br/>

Note: To run the app you have to add NewsAPI.org key. I have taken this step to due to limited access to daily request for News. Getting a key would take just few seconds :)<br/>

# Libraries:
* Retrofit For sending network requests
* Google gson For parsing JSON data
* Glide Loading and caching images
* Realm to save local data
* Joda time to manage date
* Recycler view
* Card view
